# Rust2dGameEngine

**Rust2dGameEngine** is my first game engine, initially focused on developing visual novels as a competitive alternative to Ren'Py. The engine is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing the community to create plugins and templates. Over time, I aim to expand it into a more general 2D engine, with plans to eventually add 3D support as part of a new university project.

## Key Features (Upcoming)
- **Visual novel support** as a template.
- **Modular architecture** for extensibility.
- **Plugin and custom template support** to expand functionality.

## Technologies
- **Rust**: Core development language.
- **wgpu**: For graphical rendering.

## Installation & Usage
Currently, no SDK is required, as the project is in its early stages. Detailed installation instructions will be added in future updates.
